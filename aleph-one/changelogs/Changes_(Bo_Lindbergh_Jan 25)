 *** general stuff

    Added replacement for the CSeries library in a separate directory.

	Added a replacement noresnames MPW tool.

    Changed the names of sound.h and sound.c to mysound.h and mysound.c
    in order to avoid name collision with Apple's <Sound.h>. 

    Added includes of <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <stddef.h> where
    appropriate.

    Inserted casts to void in lots of places to shut up compiler warnings
    about unused values.

    Added "static" to various local function definitions.

    Cleared up char vs. unsigned char * confusion:
        unsigned char [] and unsigned char * are used for Pascal strings.
        char [] and char * are used for C strings.
    This includes changing lots of "" to "\p".

    Removed unnecessary casts to (Ptr) in lots of places.  Most routines
    use (void *) for general memory addresses these days.

    Since SC doesn't understand #pragma unused, it's been replaced with
    cast to void everywhere.

    Updated all old MacOS API names to the current ones.
    (GetDItem -> GetDialogItem, etc.)

    Updated all old MacOS header file names to the current ones.
    (<GestaltEqu.h> -> <Gestalt.h>, etc.)

    Made #pragma segment depend on env68k instead of mpwc.

    Inserted line breaks before empty loop bodies in lots of places to shut
    up compiler warnings about extraneous semicolons.

    Changed "%P" in printf formats (used for Pascal strings) to "%.*s" and
    twiddled the corresponing arguments from string to string[0],string+1.

    Changed all qsort compare functions to have the canonical signature:
        int (void const *,void const *)

    Changed "if (var=func())" to "if ((var=func())!=0)" in lots of places
    to shut up compiler warnings about unintended assignments.

    Changed "&array" to "array" in lots of places.  Idiot MPW C and its
    idiot relaxed pointer type matching....

    Removed symbol directive in *.a files since Asm no longer likes it.

    Renamed HideMenuBar and ShowMenuBar to myHideMenuBar and myShowMenuBar
    since Apple added functions with those names in a later OS version.

*** file: buildprogram

    Added definitions of CSeriesInterfaces and CSeriesLibraries.

*** file: interface.c

    Fixed bugs in chapter sound playing code: the sound channel was
    incorrectly allocated and the sound handle wasn't locked while being
    played asynchronously.

*** file: macintosh_network.h

    Added definition of asyncUncompleted since this seemed to be the
    natural place for it.

    Cleaned up the socket listener function pointer declarations.  These
    now use the correct function signatures for 68k and UniversalProcPtr
    for PPC.

*** file: makefile

    Changed compiler names (C -> SC, PPCC -> MrC) and updated compiler
    options, linker options, list of standard libraries, etc. to match.

    Inserted lots of double quotes around variable expansions.

*** file: map_constructors.c

    Changed intersecting_flood_proc to have the canonical cost_proc
    prototype.

*** file: marathon2.resource

    Changed the desired partition size to 18 megs so you can debug the
    "everything on" case.

*** file: monsters.c

    Changed monster_activation_flood_proc and
    monster_pathfinding_cost_function to have the canonical cost_proc
    prototype.

*** file: media.c

    Removed duplicate definition of variable medias.

*** file: network_ddp.c

    Cleaned up socket listener initialization code.  Correct prototypes or
    UniversalProcPtr, etc.  Removed redundant calls to
    NewRoutineDescriptor.

*** file: physics.c

    Fixed bug where TRIG_MAGNITUDE was used as the shift count rather than
    TRIG_SHIFT.

*** file: preferences.c

    Changed the default_* and validate_* functions to have the canonical
    prototypes.

*** file: sound_macintosh.h

    Fixed bug where the default sound file wasn't loaded because
    initialize_machine_sound_manager calls open_sound_file before setting
    _sm_initialized.
