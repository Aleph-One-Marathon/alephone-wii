How to use the Map Chunker

It is a tool for moving Marathon map-file resources into the map-file data fork as M2-Win95-style chunks, reporting on what is present, and moving from chunks to resources.

More specifically, it moves 'PICT' resources (image objects), 'clut' resources (color-table objects), 'snd ' resources (sound objects), and 'TEXT' resources (MML and Pfhortran scripts) into the map-file data as chunks with types 'pict', 'clut', 'snd ', and 'text' -- and back.

To use it, open it, and select one of these commands:

File > List Chunks and Resources...

Select a map file, and it will produce a plain-text file listing what map-level chunks and what resources are present. The level listing will start at 0, and the "true" level number will be in ()'s -- it is this number that is used for searching for moved-resource chunks. Both chunks and resources will be listed by type (a 4-character code) and size, and resources will be listed by their ID's.

File > Move Resources to Chunks ...

Select a map file, and then create an output map file. It will move what resources it can into chunks of the output map file. Note: it will create 'clut' chunks for every 8-bit picture object, because these are needed for rendering those objects.

File > Move Chunks to Resources ...

Select a map file, and then create an output map file. It will move what chunks it can into resources of the output map file.
