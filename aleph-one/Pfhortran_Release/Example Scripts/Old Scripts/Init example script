-- This is a simple example of how the Init event can be used to start
-- the player off with health, oxygen, and items that they wouldn't
-- normally have.  This script starts the player with almost no oxygen,
-- 1/3 of their life gone, infra-red vision, and the missle launcher as
-- the default weapon. :)
-- Anything inside the On_Init ... End_Init event will be executed before
-- the game starts.


On_Init
Set_Oxygen 2000																		-- give the player very very little oxygen
Set_Life 100																					-- and set their life to be 2/3 full
Add_Item missile_launcher  						-- give them the SPNKR
Add_Item infravision_powerup 			 -- and give the player infra-red vision
Select_Weapon missile_launcher			-- select the SPNKR
End_Init

Script_End		-- No more instructions to execute, so end the script
