April 16, 2000
	Added files ISp_Support.c and ISp_Support.h to provide input sprockets.
	
Current version:
	Input Sprockets is always enabled unless it is not available or Mouse and Keyboard is the
	selected method of input.
	
	InputSprockets only is currently disabled because when the keyboard is treated as an Input
	Sprockets Device, the rest of the game cannot recieve keyboard events such as cmd+Q.
	
	
Changed files:
	preferences.c
	shell.c and shell.h
	vbl.c
	vbl_macintosh.c
	marathon2.resource

Comments:			
preferences.c
	
	Modification:
			preferences->input_device= GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL_DITL(item_hit, first_item)==iMOUSE_CONTROL ?
					_mouse_yaw_pitch : _keyboard_or_game_pad;
				
		changed to:
			preferences->input_device= GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL_DITL(item_hit, first_item)==iMOUSE_CONTROL ?
				_mouse_yaw_pitch : (GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL_DITL(item_hit, first_item)==iINPUT_SPROCKET_CONTROL ? 
				_input_sprocket_only : _keyboard_or_game_pad);
		reason:
			change preference option of which input method is selected
			
	Modification:
				which = (preferences->input_device == _mouse_yaw_pitch) ? iMOUSE_CONTROL : iKEYBOARD_CONTROL;
					modify_radio_button_family(dialog, LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL_DITL(iMOUSE_CONTROL, first_item), 
					LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL_DITL(iKEYBOARD_CONTROL, first_item), 
					LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL_DITL(which, first_item));
					
		changed to:
				which = (preferences->input_device == _mouse_yaw_pitch) ? iMOUSE_CONTROL : (preferences->input_device == _input_sprocket_only ? iINPUT_SPROCKET_CONTROL : iKEYBOARD_CONTROL);
					modify_radio_button_family(dialog, LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL_DITL(iMOUSE_CONTROL, first_item), 
					LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL_DITL(iINPUT_SPROCKET_CONTROL, first_item), 
					LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL_DITL(which, first_item));
					
shell.c and shell.h
	Added an initiliation command at the game startup
	Added a shutdown command at the end
	Added an input type _input_sprocket_only to the related enum
	
vbl.c
	Added commands to suspend and resume input sprockets when the keyboard controller changes.  The function
	is generally used to tell the game when it is getting keystrokes for gameplay.
	
vbl_macintosh.c
	Added commands to get actionflags from the Input Sprocket devices
	Added conditions to prevent Input Sprockets and the mouse to be active at the same time
	Added condition to prevent keymap parsing when it is set to Input Sprockets only (This is not used right now)

marathon2.resource
	Changed the Input DITL to add an InputSprocket Config button.
