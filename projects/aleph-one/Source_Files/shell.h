	thank god c doesnÕt choke on incomplete structure references.

Jul 5, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added XML support for controlling the cheats

Jul 7, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added Ben Thompson's change: an Input-Sprocket-only input mode

Aug 12, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Using object-oriented file handler

Dec 29, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added function for showing text messages on the screen

// shape is straight-coded); caller will need to free() that storage after freeing
// the SDL_Surface.
// If inIllumination is >= 0, it'd better be <= 1.  Shading tables are then used instead of the collection's CLUT.
// Among other effects (like being able to get darkened shapes), this lets player shapes be colorized according to
// team or player color.
// OK, yet another change... we now (optionally) take shape and collection separately, since there are too many
// low-level shapes in some collections to fit in the number of bits allotted.  If collection != NONE, it's taken
// as a collection and CLUT reference together; shape is (then) taken directly as a low-level shape index.
// If collection == NONE, shape is expected to convey information about all three elements (CLUT, collection,
// low-level shape index).
// Sigh, the extensions keep piling up... now we can also provide a quarter-sized surface from a shape.  It's hacky -
// the shape is shrunk by nearest-neighbor-style scaling (no smoothing), even at 16-bit and above, and it only works for RLE shapes.
