RUGBY:

Rules:
	Take the ball (the red one) to the base of your team.

What still need to be done:
	Map Editor:
		Allow choice of team color for a player starting point object, using the index
		value (map_object in map.h) for the player team color (for
		get_player_starting_location_and_facing). Team colors defined in player.h.
		Put the team color into the polygon's permutation, for the polygon type "base"
		(_polygon_is_base defined in map.h).
		THERE MUST BE 8 PLAYERS STARTING POINTS ***PER TEAM***!!!
		Allow the choice (checkbox) for rugby game type for the "entry point types"
		(defined in map.h) of a map.

To Test:
	Hold the option key when clicking on "Gather...".
	Type 819 in the "Point limit" text field.
	Assuming the ball is not on the hill, take the ball to the hill.



CAPTURE THE FLAG:

Rules:
	Take the ball of any other team to the base of your team.
	If you try to take the ball of your own team, it will come
	back to your base (unless it's already on the base).

What still need to be done:
	Map Editor:
		Implement rugby first.
		Allow all the ball colors.
		Allow the choice (checkbox) for Capture the flag game type for the
		"entry point types" (defined in map.h) of a map.
	Shapes:
		Redraw ball so that it changes color based on the color table choosen
		(the ball color).

To Test:
	Hold the option key when clicking on "Gather...".
	Type 819 in the "Flag pulls limit" text field.
	Assuming the ball is not on the hill, take the ball to the hill.
	Please note that the default ball color is red, so you should
	have at least one player in the red team.


DEFENSE:

Rules:
	The slate team (the first possible team color) the the defending team.
	The goal of all players not in the defending team is to stay on the hill
	for a specified amount of time.

What still need to be done:
	Map Editor:
		Implement rugby and capture the flag first.
		Allow the choice (checkbox) for rugby game type for the "entry point types"
		(defined in map.h) of a map.

To Test:
	Hold the option key when clicking on "Gather...".
	Type 18 in the "Time On Hill" text field.

Note:
	In the "Gather..." dialog, choosing either "Time Limit" or "Time On Hill" has
	exactly the same effect: the game will be *both* limited by the time elapsed
	since the beginning of the game ("Time Limit") and the time to stay for an
	attacker on the hill ("Time On Hill").
