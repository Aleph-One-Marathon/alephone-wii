Do you remember the first time you "played" with Marathon 2 by opening it
with ResEdit?

I do.

"Quit looking at my resource fork, Freak!", it said.

But then, you quickly find out that some network game types were grayed out
in the menu. Changing the menu with ResEdit didn't made much difference:
in the game, it crashed, bugged, it just didn't worked...

I'm now a good C/C++ programmer. M2 is now open source.
One of my dream for this game will come true...

Wow. It works. And they look pretty fun.
I still don't know what's the official reason they (Bungie, Duality?)
didn't implemented them in Marathon Infinity. I'm sure they received
thousand of e-mails asking: "Why are they grayed out?".

Whatever.

Here. You have them. Rugby, Capture the Flag and Defense.
OK, we still need a modified Map Editor to play them.
But they are there, in Aleph One. And they work.


I just need to read that "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE", and
I'll send everything to Loren.
