AlephWOne, a port of the Aleph One engine as Wii homebrew software, was developed by Mathieu Deletrain and originally published at Google Code:

The code was imported from the Google Code Archive and is hosted here for the convenience of developers wishing to learn from or extend this project. The Wii port is not supported by the Aleph One development team.
